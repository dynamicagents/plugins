# @dynamicagents/plugins

**Optional, composable capabilities for a Dynamic Agent.**

One subpath per plugin, one factory per subpath, config passed at instantiation. Your bundle
grows only with what you import.

```bash
npm install @dynamicagents/plugins
```

> Part of a three-package split:
> [`@dynamicagents/core`](https://github.com/dynamicagents/core) (the mandatory foundation) ·
> **`@dynamicagents/plugins`** (this) ·
> [`starter`](https://github.com/dynamicagents/starter) (a working agent that composes them).

## The one file you edit

```ts
// src/plugins.ts
import { arcAgi } from "@dynamicagents/plugins/arc-agi";
import { browser } from "@dynamicagents/plugins/browser";
import { recall } from "@dynamicagents/plugins/recall";

export interface PluginHost {
  env: Env;
  storage: DurableObjectStorage;
  /** The verified caller this Durable Object belongs to. See below. */
  callerKey: () => string;
}

export const plugins = ({ env, storage, callerKey }: PluginHost) => [
  arcAgi({ apiKey: env.ARC_API_KEY, storage }),
  browser({ binding: env.BROWSER }),
  recall({ ai: env.AI, index: env.VECTORIZE, namespace: callerKey })
];
```

Delete a line and that module leaves your bundle entirely. Nothing in core imports a plugin,
and there is **no root barrel** — `@dynamicagents/plugins` on its own does not resolve — so the
guarantee is structural rather than a tree-shaker's opinion. `npm run verify:exports` asserts
it on the built graph before every publish.

`plugins` is a function, not a module-level array: on Workers `env` does not exist at module
scope, and core's registry is built per Durable Object instance in `onStart()`.

```ts
export class MyAgent extends Agent<Env> {
  /** Set on the first verified request; constant thereafter. See below. */
  private identity?: string;

  async onStart() {
    this.runtime = createAgentRuntime({
      config,
      plugins: plugins({
        env: this.env,
        storage: this.ctx.storage,
        // A thunk, not a value: `onStart` runs before any request, so the caller
        // is not known yet. The DO is keyed 1:1 by that caller, so it is constant
        // once it is — this just defers reading it until it exists.
        callerKey: () => this.identity ?? ""
      }),
      env: this.env // verify every plugin's declared bindings exist, at startup
    });
  }

  async onTurn(turn: AgentTurn, identity: GatekeeperIdentity) {
    this.identity ??= identity.key!;
    // …
  }
}
```

That deferral is the whole reason `/recall` takes `namespace` as a function. Anything else
needing per-caller state takes it the same way.

## The plugins

| Subpath                            | What it adds                                                                                 | Needs                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`/arc-agi`](src/arc-agi/)         | Play ARC-AGI-3 games — a delegable subtask type, a catalogue tool, a scorecard ledger        | `ARC_API_KEY`                                |
| [`/browser`](src/browser/)         | Read web pages via Browser Rendering Quick Actions                                           | `BROWSER` (paid plan)                        |
| [`/claude-code`](src/claude-code/) | Delegate a coding task to a Claude Code session in the workspace container                   | one or more `claude setup-token` credentials |
| [`/computer`](src/computer/)       | A Linux container whose filesystem outlives it: shell, package manager, unrestricted network | `@cloudflare/computer` (paid)                |
| [`/recall`](src/recall/)           | Episodic memory over Vectorize — search history that compaction folded away                  | `VECTORIZE` (1024-dim/cosine)                |
| [`/repo`](src/repo/)               | Clone, commit, push a branch, open a pull request — over any container                       | `GITHUB_TOKEN`                               |
| [`/scratch`](src/scratch/)         | A throwaway git repository with no remote, for work that needs a container but no checkout   | —                                            |
| [`/triage`](src/triage/)           | A pre-turn gate: is this message even for me?                                                | —                                            |
| [`/workspace`](src/workspace/)     | A durable file store for long subagent runs, plus tools over it                              | `@cloudflare/shell`                          |

Each directory has its own README with the config shape and a paste-ready `wrangler.jsonc`
snippet — a plugin cannot add its own binding, which is why it declares what it needs.

---

## Writing one

```ts
import { definePlugin, type AgentPlugin } from "@dynamicagents/core";

export function scraper(config: { apiKey: string }): AgentPlugin {
  return definePlugin({
    key: "scraper",
    mainAgentTools: () => ({ fetchPage: /* … */ }),
    capability: "You can fetch and summarize a page.",
    requires: { secrets: ["SCRAPER_API_KEY"] }
  });
}
```

Three rules the whole design rests on:

- **Never name a consumer's `Env`.** It is an ambient interface `wrangler types` generates
  into _their_ app. Take bindings and secrets as config, which is also the only thing that
  works on Workers, where `env` has no module scope.
- **`definePlugin` sets `contractVersion`** from the core you compiled against. Never write
  that number as a literal — the point is that it moves, so a version train that leaves one
  repo behind fails at startup with a sentence instead of a structural-type error.
- **Declare a capability block in exactly one place.** If your plugin has a `subtaskType`, put
  it there; otherwise on the plugin. Both are rendered, by different call sites.

## Testing

Specs run inside real workerd via `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin`, with the harness from
`@dynamicagents/core/testing`.

```bash
npm test          # the whole suite, no credentials and no network
npm run check     # prettier + eslint + tsc + build
npm run verify:exports
```

### Working against an unpublished core

A plain `npm install` resolves `@dynamicagents/core` from whatever this branch's
`package.json` declares — `AGENTS.md` says which — and does it right over a local build
you are testing against.

```bash
npm run link:local   # npm pack + tarball install from ../core
```

Run it after changing core, **and after any `npm install` here**, which silently
undoes it. Skipping it is quiet and misleading: `tsc` reports errors in _this_
repo's source for a contract change sitting uninstalled one directory away.

`npm pack` + tarball, deliberately — not `npm link`, which symlinks the checkout and
gives it its own copy of every peer. Two copies of `agents` in one bundle breaks the
`Session` types and every `instanceof`, at runtime rather than at the type level.
Nothing is written to `package.json`, so CI never builds against a local checkout.

`test/arc-agi/recorded.spec.ts` drives the **real** ARC API and replays a committed
cassette, so it needs no key either. Re-record it against the live API with:

```bash
npm run test:record   # real ARC_API_KEY in .env.test (see .env.test.example)
```

The key reaches the live ARC API and nothing else: the recorder excludes the auth header, so
it never lands in the committed cassette. It reaches the spec only as a Miniflare binding —
`.env.test` is loaded into **Node's** `process.env`, which a spec running in workerd cannot
see, so `vitest.config.ts` hands it across explicitly.
