 * What the workspace's advisories mean for a command about to run.
 *
 * The distinction between the two fields is the whole point:
 *
 * - `block` — the command was **not run**.
 * - `warn` — the command **was run**, with this prepended to its output.
 *
 * ## Only something transient may block
 *
 * Enforced here by reading {@link AdvisoryShape.transient} rather than by
 * matching on a state, because getting it wrong deadlocked a production run.
 * Nothing clears a failed install record except another checkout, so blocking on
 * one disables the shell for the rest of the session — `echo hello` included —
 * while the message tells the model to re-run the install with the tool that is
 * refusing to run. The same argument covers a full workspace, which is
 * permanent in exactly the same way and would take the shell down with it,
 * including the commands an operator would use to look.
 *
 * So anything permanent is reported and the model decides. Blocking is reserved
 * for a state that resolves on its own, where waiting is a real answer.
 *
 * ## What a command is told depends on the command
 *
 * A dependency advisory reaches only commands that read `node_modules`; a
 * universal one reaches everything. That asymmetry is the reason a full
 * workspace used to say nothing at all to `echo hi > file.txt` — the write being
 * lost is usually not a dependency's, and the filter that was right for installs
 * was silently applied to capacity too.
