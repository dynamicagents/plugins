/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/computer` — a Linux container whose filesystem outlives it.
 *
 * The filesystem **is** a Durable Object's SQLite, mounted into the container
 * over FUSE by `computerd`. Commands see a normal `/workspace`; the Worker reads
 * the same tree over RPC; and when the container is replaced the tree is pushed
 * back into the new one.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `@dynamicagents/plugins/workspace`, which is a virtual
 * filesystem with no processes and nothing to run. Install exactly one
 * filesystem plugin — an agent holding two gives the model no way to know which
 * one a path refers to.
 *
 * ## `node_modules` is **not** in the workspace
 *
 * The one thing to internalise before reading further. `computerd` excludes it
 * from the sync, and the exclusion is right: pushing a real one (429 MB, 22,470
 * files) into the object exceeds the Durable Object's 128 MB isolate memory
 * limit, leaving the tree silently short — and the reconciliation that follows
 * propagates the shortfall back into the container.
 *
 * So dependencies live in the container and die with it, while source and `.git`
 * are durable. Two consequences run through everything below: an install has to
 * be re-run on a cold container, and `sb_read` cannot see a path under
 * `node_modules` even though a shell in the same container can.
 *
 * Requires the Workers **Paid** plan (containers) and a Durable Object binding
 * whose class owns the workspace — see the README for the wrangler block.

 * `ls big-dir | head -1` reports 141 rather than 0 — noisy, but *visible*, where

 * the model not to pipe into `head`/`tail` at all, since output is already

     * one is not that shelling out fails — it is where the search runs. `fs.grep`
     * reads the Durable Object's SQLite, so it answers while the container is
     * being replaced or an install is still running, which is exactly the window
     * the install gate leaves a subagent with nothing to do. It is also why this
     * tool is not gated: see {@link awaitInstall}.
     *
     * Two lesser reasons that still matter. The query arrives as a value rather
     * than through `shellQuote` and a shell that would re-parse it. And the result
     * is bounded by a `limit` at the source instead of being middle-truncated
     * afterwards, which for a match list means losing whole files silently.

/**
 * An `exec` bound to this workspace, for plugins that need a shell but should
 * not own a container.
 *
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/repo` is the reason this exists: it needs `git` on a real
 * shell, but depending on this module would weld the two together and stop a
 * host from pointing it at its own container. Structurally typed for the same
 * reason — the two plugins compose without either importing the other.
 *
 * ## {@link ComputerConfig.env} is deliberately **not** merged here
 *
 * {@link buildComputerTools} merges it into every command; this does not.
 *
 * What this hands out is a raw shell to *another plugin*, whose commands this
 * module neither writes nor sees. `/repo` runs its unauthenticated git through
 * it and pins the environment those need — `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` plus the
 * model-authored values it passes as variables. A host environment merged
 * underneath lets through every key it does *not* pin: `http_proxy`,
 * `GIT_PROXY_COMMAND`, `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, `GIT_EXEC_PATH` —
 * the last two redirect the config git reads and relocate its helper binaries.
 *
 * No token is at stake, since the credentialed operations do not run here at
 * all. The point is that changing what git does inside another plugin's commands
 * should not be something a container plugin's config field does by accident,
 * from a host that only meant to set a registry. A host that wants it composes
 * it where the merge is visible:
 *
 * ```ts
 * exec: (command, options) =>
 *   computerExec(config)(command, {
 *     ...options,
 *     env: { ...mine, ...options?.env }
 *   });
 * ```
