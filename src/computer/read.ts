/**
 * Read a file without pulling more of it across the boundary than the model will
 * be shown.
 *
 * `readFile(path, "utf8")` materialises the whole file in the isolate before
 * `truncateOutput` throws most of it away. Harmless on a source file, and the
 * wrong shape against a Durable Object's 128 MB — `sb_read` is one model decision
 * away from a lockfile, a bundle or a captured build log. The read is
 * range-addressable, so the budget is enforced at the source.
 *
 * Two reads rather than one, because the budget is spent from both ends for the
 * reason {@link truncateOutput} documents — the first error is at the top of a
 * file and the summary is at the bottom.
 *
 * ## The one place the budget is spent in bytes
 *
 * `maxChars` is a character ceiling everywhere else — see
 * {@link ComputerConfig.maxOutputChars} — and here it is spent against
 * `byteOffset`/`byteLength`, which are the only units the transport has. That is
 * deliberate and it is safe in the direction that matters: a UTF-8 byte is never
 * more than one UTF-16 code unit, so *N* bytes decode to at most *N* characters.
 * Reading the character budget as bytes therefore always honours the ceiling,
 * and errs low on a file that is mostly non-ASCII — a CJK source file is cut at
 * about a third of the characters it could have shown. The alternative is a
 * second round trip to measure what the first one returned, on every read, to
 * recover a bound the marker already announces.
 *
 * The other reason it cannot be characters is the one this function exists for:
 * bounding the *transport*. A byte range is what stops a 4 MB lockfile being
 * materialised in a 128 MB isolate before anything is thrown away.
 *
 * ## Why `stat` first
 *
 * Sizing off the returned string instead would be wrong in a way that hides
 * itself. `byteLength` counts bytes and `String.length` counts UTF-16 code units,
 * so a file of two-byte characters comes back *under* a character budget while
 * still being over the byte budget — and the read would look complete with half
 * the file missing and no marker saying so. One extra round trip buys the
 * distinction.
 *
 * A slice boundary can land mid-codepoint, which the decoder resolves to a single
 * replacement character. That is one glyph of noise at a cut that already
 * announces itself as a cut.

/**
 * Fetch a page, drop what is off-limits, and keep the source offsets that make the

 * The subtle part is why `rawIndex` exists at all. `offset` counts items at the
 * source; the caller renders a filtered, budget-trimmed subset of them. So the
 * obvious `nextOffset = offset + shown` is wrong — it silently skips or repeats
 * whenever anything was dropped, which is precisely when a skipped directory is
 * involved. Keeping each survivor's source index means the next page starts exactly
 * after the last one the model actually saw.
 *
 * Retries because a skipped directory can outnumber a whole page on its own — a
 * dependency tree runs to tens of thousands of files — so one fetch can come back
 * entirely excluded. `maxRounds` is the caller's: a retry re-reads and re-scans
 * every file the last one looked at. For a walk the store can prune instead, see
 * `sb_ls`, which passes exclusions to `find` and needs none of this.
 *
 * Deliberately no slicing to `want`: the caller needs the extra item to know a next
 * page exists, and its index to say where.
