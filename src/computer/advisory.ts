/**
 * What a caller must not assume about a workspace, and how to say it.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `InstallState`
 *
 * `InstallState` is the durable record of **a job the host ran** — core's
 * `JobState`, which owns arming, the single-flight guard, the staleness bound
 * and the generation marker. It is right for that and unchanged by this file.
 *
 * Every *reader*, though, is asking a different question: **can I rely on this
 * workspace right now?** The two diverge, and expressing the second through the
 * first goes wrong in three ways that are each easy to reintroduce:
 *
 * - A workspace at its storage ceiling is not `skipped`. That variant means
 *   "this checkout has nothing to install" — routine, and about the repository.
 *   A ceiling is a hard wall about the Durable Object, and the two are then told
 *   apart only by reading prose.
 * - Capacity must not travel through a channel gated by
 *   {@link file://./gate.ts needsDependencies}, or a full workspace says nothing
 *   at all to `echo hi > file.txt` — the command whose write is being lost.
 * - "The tree is fine now", after a subagent installed by hand, has no honest
 *   spelling as a job record: fabricating a `done` rests on the presence of a
 *   `node_modules` directory, which the wreckage of the very install being
 *   overridden already satisfies.
 *
 * So an advisory is **derived at read time** and describes the workspace, not a
 * job. Its absence is the good case, which is what removes the need to invent
 * anything: nothing to say means an empty array.
 *
 * ## One home for what each kind means
 *
 * {@link shapeOf} is the only exhaustive `switch` over {@link WorkspaceAdvisory}
 * that decides *policy*, and {@link renderAdvisory} the only one that decides
 * *wording*. Everything else reads {@link AdvisoryShape}. A new kind is a
 * compile error in exactly those two places, and whoever adds it has to say what
 * it means and what to do about it — which is the drift that put the same blind
 * spot in two independent readers, closed by the compiler rather than by
 * discipline.
