/**
 * Working out how a repository installs its dependencies, mechanically.
 *
 * The *procedure* lives here because it is the same everywhere: look at what the
 * repository actually contains, in a fixed order, and never guess. The
 * **commands** live in the host, because they are a deployment's business — one
 * repository wants `--frozen-lockfile`, another needs a private registry
 * preamble, a third has to build after installing. See
 * {@link InstallPlan.overrides}.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * The alternative is a sentence in the subagent's soul — "install dependencies
 * before you do anything else" — and a standard with no command attached is one a
 * model satisfies with whichever check is cheapest: edit a README, run
 * `prettier --check` on that one file, report the change verified, and never run
 * the project's gate at all.
 *
 * ## Why the order is fixed and written down
 *
 * A repository can carry two lockfiles — a `package-lock.json` someone forgot to
 * delete next to the `pnpm-lock.yaml` that is actually used. Resolving by
 * whichever the filesystem happens to return first makes the install
 * non-deterministic across hosts, and the failure is a confusing one: the wrong
 * package manager produces a `node_modules` that is subtly wrong rather than
 * absent. So: an explicit override wins, then the repository's own
 * `packageManager` pin, then lockfiles in the order the plan lists them.

 * Where the install has got to, as the host reports it and the tools read it.

 * to run against a tree that is still being built. A shape they agreed on
 * informally would drift, and the drift would show up as a shell command running
 * halfway through an `npm ci`.
 *
 * ## Why it is core's `JobState` with one field intersected in
 *
 * Core owns the *choreography* around a job a Durable Object drives through its
 * alarm — arming, the single-flight guard, the staleness bound, the generation
 * marker a drain checks before it writes. This package owns what an install
 * specifically **is**: which package manager, which lockfile, what counts as
 * skippable. Splitting them along that line is what lets a second job on the
 * same object — a coding-agent run, say — reuse every rule without inheriting
 * `npm ci`.
 *
 * `JobState` intersects `TExtra` into its `running`/`done`/`failed` variants
 * instead of nesting it under `meta`, so this alias is byte-identical to the
 * hand-written union it replaced. Every reader still spells `status.command` at
 * the top level and no call site moved.

 * A content fingerprint of what the install depends on, for deciding whether an

 *
 * Content, not mtime: a `git fetch && reset --hard` onto a new commit rewrites
 * these files whether or not their dependencies changed, and re-installing on
 * every commit would throw away a tree that is already correct.
 *
 * ## Both files, not just the lockfile
 *
 * `package.json` is hashed alongside the lockfile rather than only standing in
 * when there is no lockfile. The two disagree more often than they look like
 * they should: a commit can add a `postinstall`, bump the `packageManager` pin
 * from `pnpm@9` to `pnpm@10`, or add a dependency without regenerating the lock,
 * and every one of those changes what an install produces while leaving the
 * lockfile byte-identical. Hashing the lockfile alone calls that a match, skips
 * the install, and hands the subagent a `node_modules` that is quietly wrong —
 * which surfaces as a missing module in a build, three tool calls later, with
 * nothing pointing back at the install that never ran.
 *
 * The cost is the whole of the downside: a commit touching `package.json` for a
 * reason that does not affect installs — a version bump — buys one redundant
 * install. That is a far cheaper failure than the one above.
 *
 * ## An override is hashed against every lockfile the plan knows
 *
 * An override replaces the whole command, so this layer cannot know which manager
 * it drives or which lockfile it reads. Recording none would make the digest the
 * command plus `package.json` alone — so a commit changing only
 * `package-lock.json`, which is what a dependency bump is, matches the stored
 * fingerprint, skips the install, and leaves a `node_modules` a version behind.
 * {@link resolveInstallCommand} reports every lockfile the plan names that is
 * present, and all of them are hashed.
 *
 * ## And the manager's own configuration
 *
 * {@link INSTALL_CONFIG_FILES} is hashed too, for the same reason `package.json`
 * is: a lockfile says which versions, and `.npmrc` says how they are laid out.
 * Flipping pnpm's `node-linker` to `hoisted` produces a different
 * `node_modules` from a byte-identical lockfile, and a matching fingerprint
 * would otherwise skip the reinstall that change requires.
 *
 * The residual is worth stating because it cannot be closed here: an override
 * that *builds* — `npm ci && npm run build`, the documented example — is not
 * fingerprinted on the sources it builds from, because hashing `package.json`
 * cannot know what an arbitrary command reads. A host that needs a rebuild on
 * every source change should make its override cheap enough to run every time
 * rather than expect this to detect one.
 *
 * ## This is only half of the skip condition
 *
 * A matching fingerprint means "the same install would produce the same tree".
 * It does **not** mean the tree is there: it is on the container's disk, and
 * goes with the container. The caller also needs a record that this container
 * finished it — see `./host/install-job.ts`.
