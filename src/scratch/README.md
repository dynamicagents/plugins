# `@dynamicagents/plugins/scratch`

A throwaway git repository with no remote, for work that needs a container but
not a checkout.

```ts
import { scratch } from "@dynamicagents/plugins/scratch";
import { computerExec } from "@dynamicagents/plugins/computer";

scratch({
  // Runs in the container. Nothing here ever needs a credential.
  exec: computerExec({ binding: env.WORKSPACE, workspaceName: () => name })
});
```

One tool: `scratch_open`, with an optional `reset`.

## Why this exists

An agent with a container and a git plugin can do a great deal, and all of it
starts with a clone. That is right for most of the work such an agent does and
wrong for the rest of it: "check what this actually returns", "write a script and
run it", "try that regex against these twenty lines" each need a container, and
none of them needs a repository.

With no way to say so, an agent asks for one. The deployment this was written for
had a coding agent ask its user for an **empty repository to clone** so it could
run a script in the checkout. That is a workaround for a missing verb, and a good
sign the verb is missing.

## A scratchpad is a repository whose remote is nowhere

That framing is the design, and it is why this plugin is small. Everything a host
already does for a checkout applies unchanged:

- It is a real git repository, so a host's `git reset --hard && git clean -fdx`
  discards a cancelled task's edits out of it.
- It lives in the workspace, so it is durable across tasks and is reclaimed by
  whatever already reclaims the workspace.
- It goes through the host's own workspace selection, so it is keyed, routed and
  cleaned up by machinery that exists rather than by a second mechanism alongside
  it.

It has no `origin`. That is the property that makes it safe to let a session do as
it likes in one: nothing here is ever pushed anywhere, so there is no branch to
protect and no pull request to open.

### The empty initial commit

`scratch_open` makes one, and it is load-bearing rather than tidy. Without it the
repository has no `HEAD`, and `git reset --hard` fails outright — which is what a
host runs to discard a cancelled task's edits. That cleanup is best-effort in
every host that has one, so the failure is a logged warning plus a cancelled
run's files surviving into the next task as its starting point.

Because `git init` and that commit are two commands, a scratchpad can exist with
only the first. So "is there a scratchpad here" asks for the commit rather than
the repository, and a scratchpad missing it is repaired on the next open — `git
init` re-initialises without touching the tree, and an empty commit adds a `HEAD`
without touching it either.

The same question is asked from outside the scratchpad, and about the scratchpad
directory itself. From inside, it cannot be asked at all before the directory
exists; and `git rev-parse` walks upwards, so a scratchpad sitting anywhere within
another repository would answer yes and hand `reset: true` that repository's tree.

### `reset: true` empties it, including nested repositories

The clean is `-ff`. A single force leaves untracked nested repositories where
they are, and a scratchpad is where those turn up — cloning something to look at
it is one of the things it is for. The second force is safe here in a way it is
not in a checkout: nothing in a scratchpad is tracked by anything else, and
nothing in it is ever pushed.

Note that establishing the repository is _not_ the same as establishing an empty
tree: `git init` over a directory that already holds files leaves every one of
them. Only a reset makes a scratchpad empty, so that is the only case where
`scratch_open` reports emptiness without reading the tree first.

## What the host owns

The same split [`/repo`](../repo/) makes: this plugin knows what a scratchpad
_is_, the host knows how it addresses one.

```ts
scratch({
  exec: computerExec(config),
  // Select the workspace, before any command runs. Synchronous; a throw fails
  // the open, because a host that could not choose has not chosen.
  beforeOpen: () => active.set(SCRATCH),
  // Record it, and say whether you can see it.
  afterOpen: async ({ dir }) => {
    const { present } = await workspace().noteCheckout({
      dir,
      kind: "scratch"
    });
    return { ready: present };
  }
});
```

A host that wires neither still gets a working scratchpad, as long as its
workspace is not keyed per repository.

**`afterOpen` returns readiness where `RepoConfig.afterCheckout` returns `void`,
and a throw in it reaches the model rather than being logged.** Both differences
are deliberate. This plugin knows `git init` exited 0; whether the host's durable
record agrees is host knowledge, and a tool that reports success followed by a
delegation that refuses to start is the worst version of that failure — the two
are reported in different places and nothing connects them. And where a clone is
still useful to an agent whose follow-up hook failed, a scratchpad the host did
not record cannot be delegated into at all.

## Selection, not a capability

Install it on a **parent only**, never on a sub-agent. Opening a scratchpad _selects a
workspace_, exactly as `repo_clone` does. A sub-agent holding it could re-point the
workspace its parent prepared half-way through its own run; a sub-agent works in whatever
it was given.

For the same reason, the context block tells the model that a task works in a
cloned repository **or** in the scratchpad and not both. A host that keys one
workspace selection per caller points every other workspace tool at whatever was
selected last, so an agent that opens a scratchpad mid-checkout has quietly moved
its own `repo_diff` and `repo_commit` with it. That is a property of the host's
routing rather than something this plugin can prevent, which is why the model is
told the rule instead of being left to discover it.

## Requirements

None of its own. It needs a shell in a container — `exec` is injected, so
[`/computer`](../computer/)'s `computerExec` is one source of it and a host with
its own container is another. No credential, no binding, no secret.
