 * environment — which is where the properties worth protecting live. A
 * scratchpad has to be a repository that can be **reset**, a reset has to empty
 * it, and a container that did not answer must never look like a repository that
 * is not there.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here is anything about how a host addresses a
 * scratchpad — which workspace it selects, how it is recorded, when it is
 * reclaimed. That is the host's, exercised in the host's own suite through the
