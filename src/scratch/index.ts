/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/scratch` — a place to work that is not a repository.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * An agent with a container and a git plugin can do a great deal, and all of it
 * starts with a clone. That is right for the work such an agent mostly does and
 * wrong for the rest of it: "check what this actually returns", "write a script
 * and run it", "try that regex against these twenty lines" each need a container
 * and none of them needs a repository.
 *
 * With no way to say so, an agent asks for one. The deployment this was written
 * for had a coding agent ask its user for an **empty repository to clone** so it
 * could run a script in the checkout — which is a workaround for a missing verb,
 * and a good sign the verb is missing.
 *
 * ## A scratchpad is a repository whose remote is nowhere
 *
 * That framing is the design, and it is why this plugin is small. Everything a
 * host already does for a checkout applies unchanged: it is a git repository, so
 * a cancelled task's edits can be reset out of it; it lives in the workspace, so
 * it is durable and reclaimed the same way; and it goes through the host's own
 * workspace selection, so it is keyed, routed and cleaned up by the machinery
 * that already exists rather than by a second mechanism alongside it.
 *
 * It has no `origin`, which is the property that makes it safe to let a session
 * do as it likes in: nothing here is ever pushed anywhere.
 *
 * ## What the host owns
 *
 * The same split [`/repo`](../repo/) makes, and for the same reason — this plugin
 * knows what a scratchpad *is*, the host knows how it addresses one:
 *
 * - {@link ScratchConfig.beforeOpen} selects the workspace, before anything runs.
 * - {@link ScratchConfig.afterOpen} records it, and says whether the host can
 *   actually see it.
 *
 * A host that wires neither still gets a working scratchpad, as long as its
 * workspace is not keyed per repository.
