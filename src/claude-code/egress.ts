/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/claude-code` — the container's only way out.
 *
 * `egress: { mode: "http-gateway", gateway }` makes `computerd` intercept every
 * outbound request in the container and tunnel it back to the workspace Durable
 * Object, which reconstructs it against its original absolute URL and hands it
 * here. So this function sits on the **Worker side of the trust boundary** and
 * sees the whole of what the container tries to reach.
 *
 * Intercepting HTTPS means terminating it, which has a cost this file does not
 * pay and the container does: the runtime presents its own certificate, so an
 * image that has not installed the interception CA has no working HTTPS client
 * at all — not even `npm`. Nothing here can fix that from the Worker side; the
 * image's entrypoint has to, and the README's "Your image must trust the
 * interception CA" section is the whole of what that takes.
 *
 * That position is what makes three otherwise-hard things easy, and they are the
 * reason this file exists rather than a plain allowlist:
 *
 * 1. **The real credential never enters the container.** Claude Code is launched
 *    with a placeholder; the swap happens here. A `postinstall` script in a
 *    cloned repository can read every environment variable the container has and
 *    still learn nothing — which is the repository's standing rule ("hand it the
 *    action, not the credential") applied to a process nobody can constrain.
 * 2. **Any restriction that is applied is total.** Not a policy the container
 *    cooperates with; the only route out. Restriction is **off by default** —
 *    see {@link EgressConfig.restrictToHosts} for why.
 * 3. **Exhaustion is seen, so it can be routed around.** This is the only place
 *    Anthropic's actual response is visible, and therefore the only place that
 *    can learn a subscription bucket is empty. See {@link EgressConfig.store}
 *    and `credentials.ts`.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not meter, and a budget gate must not come back: an estimate of spend
 * is a guess about a bucket nobody can read, moves only once per run, and the
 * bucket announces the answer exactly — see the docblock in `credentials.ts`.
 *
 * And it does not, by default, **bound exfiltration**. The container holds the
 * checkout, and with no restriction configured it can send it anywhere. That is
 * a deliberate default rather than an oversight — the reasoning is on
 * {@link EgressConfig.restrictToHosts} — and what it means for a reader is that
 * the containment here is "the container holds no credential", full stop. Do not
 * read a host restriction that is switched off as a boundary that exists.

 * The reason is a difference between the two egress modes that is easy to miss.
 * Under `mode: "direct"` the container's traffic leaves from the container's own
 * network position. Under `http-gateway` **the Worker makes the request**, so an
 * unrestricted policy hands the container the Worker's reach rather than its
 * own — and `computer.internal` is the loopback the intercept itself rides on.
 * Bouncing a request back into it is never a legitimate fetch, so it is refused
 * before any policy is consulted.
 *
 * A workspace that overrides `egressHost` on its `CloudflareContainerBackend`
 * should add that name here; the default is what the backend uses when nothing

   * would hand the widest possible policy to an expression that returned
   * nothing.
   *
   * ## Why unrestricted is the default
   *
   * A curated list is permanently wrong for a coding agent. `esbuild`, `swc` and
   * `sharp` fetch prebuilt binaries from release CDNs; Playwright downloads
   * browsers from a third host; corepack fetches package managers; and reading
   * documentation is part of the job. The failure mode is the bad one — `npm ci`
   * dying inside a `postinstall` with a network error nobody connects to a list
   * three files away.
   *
   * Little is lost by defaulting open, because **the restriction was never what
   * protected the credential**. The swap is keyed on the destination being
   * Anthropic and credential headers are stripped from everything else, so both
   * hold whatever this says. What an unrestricted policy does give up is a bound
   * on *exfiltration*: the container holds the checkout and can send it
   * anywhere. That matches `/computer`, whose egress has always been
   * unrestricted, for the same reason.
   *
   * Matched **exactly** on hostname when set. No wildcards, and that is not an
   * omission: `*.example.com` is how a restriction quietly becomes no
   * restriction, the first time a host serves user-controlled subdomains.
