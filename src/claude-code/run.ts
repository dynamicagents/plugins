/**
 * Launching Claude Code in the workspace container, and draining it in windows.
 *
 * ## One Dynamic Agents subtask is one `claude -p` session
 *
 * Not one turn, and not one tool call. The unit has to be substantial because of
 * what an invocation costs before it does anything: the harness carries an
 * 18.7-27k token cached prefix, and a ten-call burst billed **twenty** raw input
 * tokens against 187,130 cache reads. On anything short the prefix is the bill.
 *
 * ## Detached, then re-attached — never owned by a request
 *
 * The run is spawned under an exec id and left running. Each chunk re-attaches,
 * drains for a bounded window, and returns. That shape is not a preference: a
 * drain owned by an RPC that returns in milliseconds gets disposed mid-command,
 * which is exactly how the dependency install used to die halfway through
 * `npm ci`.
 *
 * ## The cursor
 *
 * `getExec(id, { resume })` accepts `"tail"`, `"full"` **or an event sequence
 * number**, and the number is what this uses. Each chunk records the last `seq`
 * it consumed, so the next one resumes exactly there instead of replaying an
 * arbitrary tail. Replay still happens when a chunk dies before it can
 * checkpoint, which is why the progress keys stay positional (see
 * `toProgress`); the cursor makes replay rare, the keys make it harmless.
 *
 * The cursor also carries the **exec id** and the **parsed result**, and both
 * are there for reasons that only show up under concurrency or retry — see
 * {@link DrainCursor}.

 * only the final result even in stream mode.
 *
 * Note what is **absent**. No `--bare`, no `--settings` override, no
 * `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: a cloned repository's `CLAUDE.md`, skills and hooks are
 * exactly the material that makes the agent good at that repository, and the
 * container is already an arbitrary-code-execution environment by design — the
 * install runs the repo's `postinstall`, the agent runs its test suite. Stripping
 * one door while the others stand open buys nothing and costs the agent its
 * context. (§4 of the design plan, cancelled 2026-08-21.)
 *
 * No `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` either, and that one is a genuine simplification over
 * the spike: `http-gateway` egress intercepts transparently, so the client talks
 * to the real hostname and the gateway sees it. Nothing has to be told to use a
 * proxy, which means nothing in the container can be told *not* to.
 *
 * ## `--permission-mode`, and the root guard behind it
 *
 * `-p` is headless. There is no terminal, so there is nobody to answer a
 * permission prompt — and Claude Code's headless path does not wait for one, it
 * **auto-denies**. Left unset the mode is `default`, and `default` gates Write,
 * Edit and every Bash command. A session in that state reads the repository
 * perfectly and cannot change one byte of it, while reporting prose that reads
 * like considered reluctance rather than a blocked tool. That cost this
 * deployment a day of "the container is fixed but nothing lands".
 *
 * So the mode is passed explicitly, and {@link DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE} is
 * `bypassPermissions` — see
 * {@link file://./config.ts ClaudeCodeConfig.permissionMode} for why the
 * permissive value is the correct default here rather than a concession.
 *
 * **`IS_SANDBOX=1` ships in the same branch as the flag, and separating the two
 * breaks a session harder than passing no flag at all.** The container runs as
 * root, and the CLI refuses to bypass its permission checks under uid 0 unless
 * that variable is set: it calls `process.exit(1)` **before the first JSON
 * line**, with the only explanation on stderr. The failure then surfaces as
 * "exited with code 1 without reporting a result" and names nothing. One branch
 * below writes both so they cannot drift, and the variable is applied *after* a
 * host's `env` so a host cannot unset the thing making its own mode work.
 *
 * `IS_SANDBOX` has one other documented effect in this client: a repeated API
 * `529` stops raising the custom overload error and keeps retrying instead.
 * Harmless here — the egress gateway is what decides when to give up.
 *
 * The alternative is an image that does not run as root, which is a real option
 * and a much larger one: the FUSE mount, the checkout and every install path
 * currently assume uid 0. If that ever changes, this variable is the line to
