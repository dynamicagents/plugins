/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/claude-code` — the credential pool, and how exhaustion is
 * detected.
 *
 * ## Why a pool rather than a budget
 *
 * A Claude subscription has two limits that matter here: a rolling 5-hour
 * session bucket and a weekly one. Neither is readable, so staying under them by
 * *estimating* spend is the wrong instrument twice over — the estimate is a
 * guess about a bucket nobody can see, and it only moves when a run *ends*,
 * since usage is learned from the terminal `result` event. It is never a cap on
 * spend, only a gate on starting. The bucket itself says so precisely the moment
 * it is empty: Anthropic answers `429`.
 *
 * So this module does not predict. It **detects and routes around**: the
 * credential becomes an ordered pool, the gateway uses the first usable entry,
 * and a refusal moves the lead on. One mechanism covers both the 5-hour and the
 * weekly limit, because to this code they differ only in how far out the reset
 * is.
 *
 * ## A mark lasts one session
 *
 * A spent or rejected mark is Anthropic's answer at the time, not a fact until
 * `resetAt`: a plan upgrade, extra usage switched on, or a reset Anthropic
 * grants early all make it wrong, and a deployment that trusts it refuses work
 * Anthropic would take, for hours. Asking again is nearly free — a refusal bills
 * nothing and comes back in milliseconds, and rotating through a pool of three
 * spent credentials has taken about a second. So a host calls
 * {@link CredentialPool.reopen} when it admits a session, and that session's
 * first model call marks again whatever is still spent. Within the session the
 * marks route as above.
 *
 * ## Everything here is pure
 *
 * No storage, no `fetch`, no Durable Object — the host passes a
 * {@link CredentialStore} and the clock. That is the discipline `JobLifecycle`
 * and `InstallProbe` already set in this repository, and it is what lets the
 * rotation rules be specified without a container: a pool with a fake store is
 * two object literals.
 */

/**
 * One entry's state, as the host persists it.
 *
 * `resetAt` is a wall-clock ms deadline; `0` means usable now. `dead` is a
 * different claim from an exhausted bucket and is kept separate for that reason:
 * a spent credential recovers by itself at `resetAt`, a rejected one never does
 * on a timer. Collapsing them would resurrect a revoked token at some distant
 * `resetAt`. Both are cleared by {@link CredentialPool.reopen}, which is not a
 * timer: a revoked token costs one `401` per session and is rotated away.

   * Which credential this state describes — see {@link fingerprint}.

   * an operator edits the secrets, and then it is quietly wrong at the worst
   * possible moment: rotating a spent token — the exact thing an operator does
   * when the pool has stalled — would leave the fresh credential inheriting the
   * old one's `resetAt`, or its `dead` flag, which nothing clears. Removing the
   * first secret so the second slides down has the same effect, and the
   * documented `.filter(Boolean)` pattern makes that a one-character change.
   *
   * Keying on the credential fixes reordering for free, and makes a replaced
   * credential simply *unknown* — which is the fail-open direction, and the
   * right one: an unknown credential gets tried.
