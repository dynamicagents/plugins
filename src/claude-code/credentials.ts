/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/claude-code` — the credential pool, and how exhaustion is
 * detected.
 *
 * ## Why a pool rather than a budget
 *
 * A Claude subscription has two limits that matter here: a rolling 5-hour
 * session bucket and a weekly one. Neither is readable, and 0.5.0 tried to stay
 * under them by *estimating* spend — a counter in dollars, a cap, and a gate
 * that refused to start work when the counter got high.
 *
 * That was the wrong instrument. The estimate is a guess about a bucket nobody
 * can see, and it only moved when a run *ended* (usage is learned from the
 * terminal `result` event), so it was never a cap on spend at all — only a gate
 * on starting. Meanwhile the bucket itself says so, precisely, the moment it is
 * empty: Anthropic answers `429`.
 *
 * So this module does not predict. It **detects and routes around**: the
 * credential becomes an ordered pool, the gateway uses the first usable entry,
 * and a refusal moves the lead on. One mechanism covers both the 5-hour and the
 * weekly limit, because to this code they differ only in how far out the reset
 * is.
 *
 * ## Everything here is pure
 *
 * No storage, no `fetch`, no Durable Object — the host passes a
 * {@link CredentialStore} and the clock. That is the discipline `JobLifecycle`
 * and `InstallProbe` already set in this repository, and it is what lets the
 * rotation rules be specified without a container: a pool with a fake store is
 * two object literals.
 */

/**
 * One entry's state, as the host persists it.
 *
 * `resetAt` is a wall-clock ms deadline; `0` means usable now. `dead` is a
 * different claim from an exhausted bucket and is kept separate for that reason:
 * a spent credential recovers by itself at `resetAt`, a rejected one never does
 * and needs an operator. Collapsing them would either resurrect a revoked token
 * on a timer or retire a good one permanently.
 */
export interface CredentialState {
  /**
   * Which credential this state describes — see {@link fingerprint}.
   *
   * **It binds the state to a credential rather than to a slot**, and that is
   * the whole reason it exists. State keyed by array position looks fine until
   * an operator edits the secrets, and then it is quietly wrong at the worst
   * possible moment: rotating a spent token — the exact thing an operator does
   * when the pool has stalled — would leave the fresh credential inheriting the
   * old one's `resetAt`, or its `dead` flag, which nothing clears. Removing the
   * first secret so the second slides down has the same effect, and the
   * documented `.filter(Boolean)` pattern makes that a one-character change.
   *
   * Keying on the credential fixes reordering for free, and makes a replaced
   * credential simply *unknown* — which is the fail-open direction, and the
   * right one: an unknown credential gets tried.
