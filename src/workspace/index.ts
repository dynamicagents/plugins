/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/workspace` — a durable file store for long subagent runs,
 * and the model-facing tools over it.
 *
 * Core already owns the *interface*: `WorkspaceHandle`, `WorkspaceBacking`, the
 * per-file and file-count caps, and `makeWorkspaceHandle` which enforces them.
 * What core deliberately does not own is a **backend**, because the only good
 * one is `@cloudflare/shell` and shell is experimental ("expect breaking
 * changes"). An agent that never delegates file work should not carry that
 * dependency, so it ships here and is an optional peer.
 *
 * This is the only `@cloudflare/shell` import surface in the package, and stays
 * that way: everything else codes against core's stable wrapper rather than
 * shell's large, churning API.
 *
 * Two halves, and they are independent:
 *
 * - `workspaceBacking` gives every subagent execution a real file store. An
 *   agent that installs this plugin and nothing else still benefits, because the
 *   tool families that persist session state to the workspace now have somewhere
 *   durable to put it.
 * - the `workspace` tool family puts `ws_read`/`ws_write`/`ws_list` in front of
 *   the *model*, so it can keep notes across a context window it will outlive.
 *
 * A recipe opts into the second by naming `workspace` in its `toolFamilies`;
 * the first applies to every execution regardless.

 * separately from the plugin so they unit-test without a runtime, and so a host
 * with its own tool assembly can reuse them.
