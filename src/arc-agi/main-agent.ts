  return `## Playing an ARC-AGI-3 game

When the user asks for a game to be played (e.g. "play game ls20"), you can
delegate in parallel subtasks of "type": "arc-game" per game they named.

Each of those subtasks carries "params": { "game_id": "<id>" }, an exact id from
\`arc_list_games\`. The param is what starts the play, and the "prompt" is never a
substitute for it. Restate the request in the "prompt" as well (e.g. "Play the
ARC-AGI-3 game ls20."), so the subagent knows what it was asked for.

If the request does not name a game, or names it loosely — call \`arc_list_games\`
first and delegate the id associated with "ls20". Never invent an id or pass through
the user's wording as one. If nothing in the list matches well enough to choose,
ask the user which game they mean with \`${names.finalReplyTool}\` rather than guessing.

### What to put in the prompt

Give it the goal, and give it what earlier plays actually established — labeled as
what it is. Write "an earlier play observed …" for something a play reported seeing,
and "we suspect …" for a hypothesis, so it can tell what to verify from what to use.
A route or a map you pass down is a guess about a level nobody has finished; stated
as fact, it gets followed off a cliff.

Do **not** state mechanics of the tools or the budget: how many actions it has, how
many moves fit in one call, how many turns it may spend. It is told all of that
directly, it is told correctly, and a number you supply that disagrees will be
believed over the truth — a play once stopped early because its prompt said it had
"20 actions total" when 20 was its turn budget.

These subtasks take several minutes — acknowledge in your "reply" that you have started playing
and will report back, without promising a time.`;
