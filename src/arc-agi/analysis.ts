 *
 * Two rendering registers, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 * - **Prose** (diffs, shapes, histogram) names its colors: `blue->white` carries
 *   structure a bare `9->0` hides, and no tool input ever takes a color, so the
 *   index is never needed as an argument.
 * - **Grids** ({@link renderGrid}, {@link renderRegion}) stay one character per
 *   cell and carry a {@link renderLegend} instead. One char per cell is the only
 *   reason a 64×64 board is legible at all; a named cell would be unreadable and
 *   cost ~50× the tokens.
