/**
 * The `arc_scorecards` data layer, against real SQLite in a real Durable Object.
 *
 * No mocks and no stubs, because the thing under test is precisely whether the
 * hand-written DDL and the drizzle table declaration agree — and only workerd's
 * SQLite can answer that. The scorecard *policy* above this takes the narrow
 * `ScorecardStore` port and is tested against an in-memory fake instead.
 *
 * The table is a recency ledger, not a lifecycle: nothing closes a card (the ARC
 * API retires an idle one on its own), so what these specs pin is the clock —
 * which card `findRecent` picks, and that `touch` moves it.
