/**
 * ARC-AGI-3 REST API + session types. The API plays a visual-reasoning game on a
 * 64×64 grid of color values 0–15; see https://docs.arcprize.org.
 *
 * Two lifecycles meet here, and neither belongs to a model:
 *
 * - The **scorecard** is a container that aggregates many plays. The API opens
 *   one on request and auto-closes it after ~15 minutes idle, so nothing here
 *   ever closes one: the parent leases the most recently used card and records it
 *   in its DO SQLite (`db.scorecards`) purely to know how fresh it is.
 * - A **play** is one RESET→ACTION* run inside a scorecard, driven by a subagent.
 *   All state that must survive across durable chunks (cookies, guid, frames,
 *   metrics) lives in the workspace as {@link ArcSession}, written by the tool
 *   family. A subagent is handed a resolved card; it never opens or chooses one.
