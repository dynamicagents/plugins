/**
 * The `arc_scorecards` table — cards this agent opened, as a **recency ledger**
 * rather than a lifecycle.
 *
 * The ARC API auto-closes a card after ~15 minutes idle, so nothing here ever
 * closes one and there is no open/closed state worth keeping: a card used
 * recently is live, an older one is gone. `last_used_at` is that clock, bumped
 * every time a play resolves onto the card, and the only column anything queries
 * by — see `resolveScorecard` in {@link file://./scorecard.ts}.
 *
 * ## Why the DDL is hand-written and the queries are not
 *
 * A plugin must never run drizzle's durable-sqlite **migrator**: it keeps one
 * flat integer journal and one global `__drizzle_migrations` table, which two
 * independently-versioned packages cannot share: two agents consuming the same
 * module fork that journal at the first index they disagree on. And
 * `drizzle-kit generate` diffs against a snapshot in a single output directory,
 * so a plugin shipping from its own repo cannot produce a correct diff at all.
 *
 * None of that touches the **query builder**, which is a typed wrapper over the
 * same `DurableObjectStorage` holding no journal and no connection state. So the
 * split is: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` by hand in {@link arcScorecardStore},
 * every read and write through drizzle below. A second handle alongside core's
 * `AgentDB` is safe — neither carries state the other can disturb.
 *
 * The table is prefixed `arc_` because a plugin's tables share one SQLite
 * database with core's and with every other installed plugin's. An unprefixed
 * `scorecards` is a name a second plugin could plausibly want.
