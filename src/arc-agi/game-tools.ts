/**
 * The **main agent's** ARC tool: the game catalogue, and nothing else.
 *
 * **No scorecard lifecycle here.** The API retires an idle card itself, so a
 * card opened, named and closed by the model is a lifecycle modelled twice with
 * every play depending on the model's bookkeeping. The card is leased by the
 * recipe (see {@link file://./scorecard.ts}) and never named here, so the only
 * thing the main agent needs from ARC is the exact game id to delegate with.
 *
 * Handlers are exported separately from the `tool()` wiring so they unit-test
 * without an LLM, and the client is closed over so it is never model input.
